# Comfy: The Quilt Collab Discord Bot

This repository contains the code behind Comfy, a small utility bot that helps us out on the Quilt Community Collab
server. This is a separate bot from [Cozy](https://github.com/QuiltMC/cozy-discord), and it doesn't have access to 
any resources or data that Cozy does - it's just for this one specific server.

Feel free to adapt it for your own servers if you'd like!
